Project Requirements

Bash

Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs

All your Bash script files will be interpreted on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS

All your files should end with a new line

A README.md file, at the root of the folder of the project, is mandatory

All your Bash script files must be executable

Your Bash script must pass shellcheck without any error

The first line of all your Bash scripts should be exactly #!/usr/bin/env bash

The second line of all your Bash scripts should be a comment explaining what is the script doing

The advantage of using #!/usr/bin/env bash instead of /bin/bash for instance is that it will make your script portable for different OS where Bash might be in a different location.
